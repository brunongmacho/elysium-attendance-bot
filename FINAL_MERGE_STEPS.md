   2934d68..beee0fa  main -> main
```

---

## 🔄 What Happens Next (Automatic)

### 1. GitHub Actions (1-2 minutes)
- ✅ Workflow triggers: "Deploy to Google Apps Script"
- ✅ Code.js deploys to Google Apps Script
- ✅ New functions available: `getAttendanceState`, `saveAttendanceState`

**Monitor:** https://github.com/brunongmacho/elysium-attendance-bot/actions

---

### 2. Koyeb Auto-Deploy (2-5 minutes)
- ✅ Detects new commit on main
- ✅ Builds new Docker image
- ✅ Deploys to production
- ✅ Bot restarts automatically

**Monitor:** Koyeb Dashboard → Your Service

---

### 3. Bot Startup (30 seconds)
Watch for these log messages:

```
✅ Bot logged in as <BotName>
📊 Tracking 34 bosses
🟢 Main Guild: 1401784124469149736
✅ Attendance module initialized
✅ Auctioneering system initialized
✅ Bidding system initialized
📊 Attempting to load attendance state from Google Sheets...
ℹ️ No saved attendance state found
  (This is normal on first run)
✅ State recovered
🔄 Starting periodic state sync to Google Sheets...
```

---

## ✅ Post-Merge Verification

### Test 1: Bot Online
**In Discord:**
```
!help
```

**Expected:** Help embed appears with all commands

---

### Test 2: Spawn Boss
**In Discord:**
```
!spawn ego
```

**Expected:**
- Thread created
- Embed with "React ✅ to confirm"

---

### Test 3: Check Points
**In Discord:**
```
!mypoints
```

**Expected:** Your current points displayed

---

### Test 4: Status
**In Discord:**
```
!status
```

**Expected:** Bot status embed with:
- Uptime
- Active spawns
- Memory usage
- Bot version

---

## 📊 Verify Google Sheets

### Check Hidden Sheets Created

1. **Open Google Sheets:**
   - ID: `1dGLGjmRhvG0io1Yta5ikfN-b_U-SSJJfWIHznK18qYQ`

2. **Look for hidden sheets:**
   - `_BotState` (bidding state)
   - `_AttendanceState` (will be created after first spawn)

3. **How to view hidden sheets:**
   - Click sheet tabs dropdown (bottom left)
   - Select "Show all sheets"
   - You should see sheets starting with `_`

---

## 🧪 State Persistence Test

This is THE critical test:

### Test: State Survives Restart

**Step 1:** Create state
```
In Discord: !spawn viorent
(Don't close it yet)
```

**Step 2:** Restart bot
```
In Koyeb Dashboard:
- Go to your service
- Click "Restart"
- Wait for bot to come back online (1-2 minutes)
```

**Step 3:** Verify recovery
```
Check Koyeb logs for:
✅ Attendance state loaded from Google Sheets
   - Active spawns: 1
   - Active columns: 0
   - Pending verifications: 0

In Discord: !status
(Should show 1 active spawn)

In Discord thread: !close
(Should close successfully)
```

**If this test passes:** ✅ **STATE PERSISTENCE IS WORKING!**

---

## 📈 Monitor Performance

### Memory Usage (Critical for Koyeb)

**Check in Koyeb:**
1. Service → Metrics tab
2. Watch "Memory" graph
3. Should stay **< 512MB**

**Over 1 hour:**
- Initial: ~350-400MB
- Steady state: ~380-420MB
- Peak: < 450MB

**If > 512MB:** Check logs for memory leaks

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Bot Won't Start

**Check:**
1. Koyeb logs for error message
2. Verify DISCORD_TOKEN environment variable
3. Check Google Sheets webhook URL in config.json

**Solution:**
```bash
# In Koyeb Dashboard:
Settings → Environment Variables
Verify: DISCORD_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

---

### Issue: GitHub Actions Failed

**Check:**
1. https://github.com/brunongmacho/elysium-attendance-bot/actions
2. Click failed workflow
3. Look for error message

**Common Issue:** CLASPRC_JSON secret not set

**Solution:**
```bash
# Generate new clasp credentials
clasp login
cat ~/.clasprc.json

# Copy contents to GitHub:
Settings → Secrets → CLASPRC_JSON
```

---

### Issue: State Not Saving

**Check:**
1. Koyeb logs for "✅ Attendance state synced"
2. Google Sheets for `_AttendanceState` sheet
3. Sheet has data in columns: Key, Value, LastUpdated

**Solution:**
- Wait 5 minutes (auto-sync interval)
- Or create spawn and close it (triggers sync)

---
