# Fixes Summary - 2025-10-30

## 1. Discord Bot Commands Fixed

### Added Leaderboard Commands
**Files Changed:** `index2.js`

- **Added `!leadatt`** - Shows attendance leaderboard (admin only)
- **Added `!leadbid`** - Shows bidding points leaderboard (admin only)
- **Added `!week`** - Manually triggers weekly report (admin only)

**Changes Made:**
1. Added command aliases to `COMMAND_ALIASES` object (lines 33-35)
2. Added `weeklyreport` handler to `commandHandlers` object (lines 1763-1772)
3. Added command recognition in message handler (lines 2259-2288)

**Testing:** Commands should now work anywhere except spawn threads. Use in admin logs channel.

## 2. Sweep 3 Empty Column Detection Fixed

### Fixed Timestamp Parsing
**File Changed:** `attendance.js`

**Problem:** Sweep 3 was incorrectly reporting old columns as "columns without threads" because JavaScript's `Date()` constructor couldn't parse the "MM/DD/YY HH:MM" format properly.

**Solution:** Added proper timestamp parsing using regex to extract components and construct the Date object correctly.

**Changes Made (lines 556-571):**
```javascript
// Parse MM/DD/YY HH:MM format properly
const match = col.timestamp.match(/(\d{2})\/(\d{2})\/(\d{2})\s+(\d{2}):(\d{2})/);
if (match) {
  const [_, month, day, year, hour, minute] = match;
  const fullYear = 2000 + parseInt(year);
  const colTime = new Date(fullYear, parseInt(month) - 1, parseInt(day), parseInt(hour), parseInt(minute)).getTime();

  if (colTime > threeHoursAgo) {
    // Only report if within 3 hours
  }
}
```

**Result:** Sweep 3 will now only report columns without threads if they're actually recent (within 3 hours).

## 3. Google Sheets Code.js Fixes

### A. Fixed `updateTotalAttendanceAndMembers`
**File Changed:** `Code.js` (lines 1223-1254)

**Problems Fixed:**
1. ‚ùå Was adding new members to **ALL** weekly sheets (including past weeks)
2. ‚ùå Could overwrite existing data in historical sheets
3. ‚ùå Function name implies it updates members, but it shouldn't touch weekly sheets

**Solution:** Modified function to **ONLY** update the "TOTAL ATTENDANCE" sheet. It does NOT touch any weekly sheets.

**Key Changes:**
- Removed ALL code that modifies weekly sheets
- Function now only reads from weekly sheets and updates TOTAL ATTENDANCE
- New members are added to weekly sheets by `handleSubmitAttendance()` when attendance is submitted by the bot
- Added clear documentation that this function does not modify weekly sheets

**Before:**
```javascript
// Step 3: Sync new members into all weekly sheets (or current week)
sheets.forEach(sheet => { ... }); // BAD: Updates sheets
```

**After:**
```javascript
// NOTE: This function does NOT modify weekly sheets
// New members are added to weekly sheets automatically by handleSubmitAttendance()
// This function ONLY updates TOTAL ATTENDANCE sheet
```

**What it does now:**
1. ‚úÖ Reads attendance data from all ELYSIUM_WEEK_* sheets
2. ‚úÖ Calculates total attendance per member
3. ‚úÖ Updates TOTAL ATTENDANCE sheet
4. ‚úÖ Does NOT touch any weekly sheets

### B. Fixed `handleSubmitAttendance` - New Member Insertion
**File Changed:** `Code.js` (lines 445-466)

**Problem:** When adding new members, formulas weren't being copied, leading to manual work.

**Solution:** Added formula copying when new members are inserted.

**Key Changes:**
- Copies formulas from previous row for columns B, C, D (Points Consumed, Points Left, Attendance Points)
- Ensures new members have the same formulas as existing members
- Prevents manual formula entry

## 4. Google Apps Script Trigger Recommendations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Review Your Triggers!

You mentioned that `updateBiddingPoints` and `updateTotalAttendanceAndMembers` were set to run on **"Edit"** and **"Hourly"** triggers.

### **Recommended Trigger Configuration:**

#### ‚úÖ **REMOVE These Triggers:**
- ‚ùå **On Edit** trigger for `updateTotalAttendanceAndMembers` - This runs on EVERY edit and is too frequent
- ‚ùå **Hourly** trigger for `updateTotalAttendanceAndMembers` - This is excessive

#### ‚úÖ **KEEP/ADD These Triggers:**
- ‚úÖ **`updateBiddingPoints`** - Run **Hourly** (this is fine)
  - Updates bidding points based on attendance
  - Needs to run regularly to stay in sync

- ‚úÖ **`updateTotalAttendanceAndMembers`** - Run **Daily at 1am** (once per day is enough)
  - Updates TOTAL ATTENDANCE sheet ONLY
  - Does NOT modify weekly sheets (bot handles that)
  - Running daily prevents performance issues

### How to Set Up Triggers:

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Go to **Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script**
3. Click on **Triggers** (clock icon on left sidebar)
4. Remove any "On Edit" triggers for `updateTotalAttendanceAndMembers`
5. Set `updateTotalAttendanceAndMembers` to run **Time-driven ‚Üí Day timer ‚Üí 1am to 2am**
6. Keep `updateBiddingPoints` on **Time-driven ‚Üí Hour timer ‚Üí Every hour**

### Why These Changes?

| Function | Old Trigger | New Trigger | Reason |
|----------|------------|-------------|--------|
| `updateTotalAttendanceAndMembers` | On Edit / Hourly | Daily (1am) | Only updates TOTAL ATTENDANCE sheet; reduces performance load |
| `updateBiddingPoints` | Hourly | Hourly | Needs to stay in sync with attendance changes |
