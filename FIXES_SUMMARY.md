# Fixes Summary - 2025-10-30

## 1. Discord Bot Commands Fixed

### Added Leaderboard Commands
**Files Changed:** `index2.js`

- **Added `!leadatt`** - Shows attendance leaderboard (admin only)
- **Added `!leadbid`** - Shows bidding points leaderboard (admin only)
- **Added `!week`** - Manually triggers weekly report (admin only)

**Changes Made:**
1. Added command aliases to `COMMAND_ALIASES` object (lines 33-35)
2. Added `weeklyreport` handler to `commandHandlers` object (lines 1763-1772)
3. Added command recognition in message handler (lines 2259-2288)

**Testing:** Commands should now work anywhere except spawn threads. Use in admin logs channel.

## 2. Sweep 3 Empty Column Detection Fixed

### Fixed Timestamp Parsing
**File Changed:** `attendance.js`

**Problem:** Sweep 3 was incorrectly reporting old columns as "columns without threads" because JavaScript's `Date()` constructor couldn't parse the "MM/DD/YY HH:MM" format properly.

**Solution:** Added proper timestamp parsing using regex to extract components and construct the Date object correctly.

**Changes Made (lines 556-571):**
```javascript
// Parse MM/DD/YY HH:MM format properly
const match = col.timestamp.match(/(\d{2})\/(\d{2})\/(\d{2})\s+(\d{2}):(\d{2})/);
if (match) {
  const [_, month, day, year, hour, minute] = match;
  const fullYear = 2000 + parseInt(year);
  const colTime = new Date(fullYear, parseInt(month) - 1, parseInt(day), parseInt(hour), parseInt(minute)).getTime();

  if (colTime > threeHoursAgo) {
    // Only report if within 3 hours
  }
}
```

**Result:** Sweep 3 will now only report columns without threads if they're actually recent (within 3 hours).

## 3. Google Sheets Code.js Fixes

### A. Fixed `updateTotalAttendanceAndMembers`
**File Changed:** `Code.js` (lines 1210-1278)

**Problems Fixed:**
1. ❌ Was adding new members to **ALL** weekly sheets (including past weeks)
2. ❌ Could overwrite existing data in historical sheets
3. ❌ Inefficient when triggered frequently

**Solution:** Modified function to ONLY add new members to the **current week sheet**.

**Key Changes:**
- Added logic to determine current week sheet
- Only syncs new members to active week (not historical weeks)
- Properly copies formulas from previous row for new members
- Fills FALSE for all existing spawn columns when adding new members
- Added logging for debugging

**Before:**
```javascript
// Step 3: Sync new members into all weekly sheets
sheets.forEach(sheet => { ... }); // BAD: Updates ALL sheets
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Step 3: ONLY sync new members to CURRENT WEEK sheet
const currentWeekSheet = ss.getSheetByName(currentWeekSheetName);
if (currentWeekSheet) { ... } // GOOD: Only updates current week
```

### B. Fixed `handleSubmitAttendance` - New Member Insertion
**File Changed:** `Code.js` (lines 445-466)

**Problem:** When adding new members, formulas weren't being copied, leading to manual work.

**Solution:** Added formula copying when new members are inserted.

**Key Changes:**
- Copies formulas from previous row for columns B, C, D (Points Consumed, Points Left, Attendance Points)
- Ensures new members have the same formulas as existing members
- Prevents manual formula entry

## 4. Google Apps Script Trigger Recommendations

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Review Your Triggers!

You mentioned that `updateBiddingPoints` and `updateTotalAttendanceAndMembers` were set to run on **"Edit"** and **"Hourly"** triggers.

### **Recommended Trigger Configuration:**

#### ✅ **REMOVE These Triggers:**
- ❌ **On Edit** trigger for `updateTotalAttendanceAndMembers` - This runs on EVERY edit and is too frequent
- ❌ **Hourly** trigger for `updateTotalAttendanceAndMembers` - This is excessive

#### ✅ **KEEP/ADD These Triggers:**
- ✅ **`updateBiddingPoints`** - Run **Hourly** (this is fine)
  - Updates bidding points based on attendance
  - Needs to run regularly to stay in sync

- ✅ **`updateTotalAttendanceAndMembers`** - Run **Daily at 1am** (once per day is enough)
  - Updates TOTAL ATTENDANCE sheet
  - Adds new members to current week ONLY
  - Running daily prevents performance issues

### How to Set Up Triggers:

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Go to **Extensions → Apps Script**
3. Click on **Triggers** (clock icon on left sidebar)
4. Remove any "On Edit" triggers for `updateTotalAttendanceAndMembers`
5. Set `updateTotalAttendanceAndMembers` to run **Time-driven → Day timer → 1am to 2am**
6. Keep `updateBiddingPoints` on **Time-driven → Hour timer → Every hour**

### Why These Changes?

| Function | Old Trigger | New Trigger | Reason |
|----------|------------|-------------|--------|
| `updateTotalAttendanceAndMembers` | On Edit / Hourly | Daily (1am) | Prevents overwriting past weeks; reduces performance load |
| `updateBiddingPoints` | Hourly | Hourly | Needs to stay in sync with attendance changes |
